The upcoming plugin version 1.1.5 will have working audio inputs.

In the plugin world, this means that you just have to feed any audio data to the plugin input and it will appear as IN L+R on the Virus B/C.

What can you do with it?

- Feed the audio signal to the filters and FX section
- Use the envelope follower to drive the filter cutoff
- Use the integrated Vocoder for robotic voices or other special effects (try it on drums!)
- Use the input as FM source for Oscillator 2

Two example videos to see what you can do with it:
