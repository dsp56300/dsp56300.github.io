Having said that, this video shows the current state of the Waldorf microQ emulator in action.

As we do not only emulate the DSP, but the full machine this time, the test program is a bit different. It displays the full microQ in a terminal GUI and can be fully operated via keyboard. The test program runs in realtime and features Midi in/out and Audio out.

The emulator is run on an i7 4790k (~2014), the CPU usage is shown at the bottom of the video.
