We recently made a lot of progress with Vavra, the Waldorf microQ emulator, time for an update.

The GUI contains two skins, one is closely designed to match the device and is intended to be used to preserve the device as it was in a digital form. The second skin is a fully fledged editor to allow easy editing of patches.

Below are two videos of it in action.

The plugin is in alpha stage at the moment. It cannot store the state of the project yet and misses the Drum and Multi modes. It is tested exclusively by donators.
