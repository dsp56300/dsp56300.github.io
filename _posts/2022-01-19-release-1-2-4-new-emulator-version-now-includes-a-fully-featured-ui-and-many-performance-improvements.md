We are very happy to announce that we have reached a state where the emulator can be used without any external editors. The emulator now includes its own user interface for Virus B & Virus C!

The UI has been contributed by multiple external developers, we would like to thank everyone being involved in this! 👍

Furthermore, the emulation code of the DSP 56300 has been optimized, better performance results in speed improvements between 10% and 20% to make the emulation usable even on older CPUs.
