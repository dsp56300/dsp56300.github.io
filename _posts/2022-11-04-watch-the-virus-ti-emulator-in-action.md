The two videos below have been recorded with an early alpha version of the TI emulator.

Further optimizations on the DSP emulation side made it possible that these videos were recorded in realtime on a rather old i7 4790k CPU (~2014, 4 cores, 8 threads), CPU usage per thread can be seen in the first video. As expected, while the TI runs in Single Mode, only the first DSP is used, that is why the thread load for the first DSP is higher than for the second one.

The second video showcases the TI as FX unit by routing a song to the inputs.
