We have updated our [Technical Info](/technical/osirus-c#virusti) page with some insights about how the multi-DSP setup on the Virus TI works. Also, it has a useful tip for hardware TI owners to maximize voice count in Multi Mode / Sequencer Mode, enjoy! 👍

As questions are imminent, a statement regarding Virus TI emulation:

Virus TI emulation development is done in a private fork of the public project. We do this with the goal to have the whole line of Virus synthesizers emulated, to improve the accuracy and feature set of the emulation in general, to learn about the internal architecture as a preparation for other future synthesizers and of course, because it is a lot of fun!

However, currently we do not have plans to release a version of the emulator that supports the Virus TI, TI2 or Snow as this generation of synthesizers is still being sold. We do not want to negatively impact current or future sales of Kemper GmbH or affiliates, it is exactly the opposite. We appreciate the achievements of Access Music / Kemper and created Virus B & C emulators as an appreciation and to preserve these great synthesizers in a digital form.
