In contrast to a Virus C, that is clocked at 136 MHz, the Virus B runs at 108 Mhz. That's why we had the idea to try a Virus B ROM in the emulator to get rid of audio drops.

The Virus B ROM is version 4.9. We use VirusHC with a loopMIDI device to edit it.

As you can hear, the Virus B works flawlessly - and is a lot of fun! 😍
