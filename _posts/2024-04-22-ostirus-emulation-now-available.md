The Usual Suspects is happy to announce the release of our latest emulation, OsTIrus. OsTIrus is a plugin which supports emulation of the Access Virus TI line of synthesizers. Like our previous emulators Osirus and Vavra, OsTIrus runs inside your DAW directly and can be controlled like any normal softsynth. Past users of the Virus TI will be able to relive their experience with this legendary synthesizer while having all the modern comforts of software plugins.

OsTIrus supports loading multiple instances, multitimbrality, enhanced voice allocation, and can be used as an FX plugin for other tracks in your DAW. Unlike other software versions of hardware inspired plugins, OsTIrus is already capable of producing bit-accurate output of the original by emulating the digital processors at the heart of the Virus TI.

OsTIrus is available for download from our website at the following link:
