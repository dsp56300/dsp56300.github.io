## How to Ask For Help (general for all Emulators)

We understand that questions or issues may come up when using our emulators. Here are some guidelines that we humbly request to be followed when for asking for assistance or guidance:

**Read The Website and Manuals**

**Fully explore our website** [//](//) to find a wealth of information about these emulators such as blog posts, feature-specific articles, installation guides, download links, Changelogs describing fixes and new features added, and other important information.  
  
**Please ensure you have carefully read and follow the applicable documentation** that has been provided for the emulator(s) to include our [Install Guide](//installation-guide/), [FAQ](//faqs/), [Patch Manager Guide](//2024/02/06/patch-manager-introduction/), and any other specific feature guides. This should be your first stop.

**Read the manufacturer's guides and manuals for the synths themselve**s; this can provide you with nearly everything you need to know about how the synth itself works (aside from our emulator plugin-specific features) and is an essential part of the synth emulation experience. Many of your questions about features are answered within the original manuals and we **_expect_** users to be familiar with how the original synths themselves work.

****Join the Discord** Server and Learn How It Works**

We provide support **_only_** though our Discord; you can join [HERE](https://discord.com/invite/WJ9cxySnsM) . You will follow a simple Onboarding process where you will tell us a bit about yourself and read/accept our **#rules**. You must actually read these rules and accept them; ignorance of them is no excuse for breaking them and **_we expect all members to follow and obey our rules_**. Once you are in, you will have access to a variety of channels and content that will enhance your experience with our emulators.

It is very important to **Learn the Discord Channel layout**. For the best experience we recommend using the Discord client for your computer or at least viewing it on your computer using your web browser. Discord can be confusing and difficult to navigate, especially on mobile devices. We have many different emulators with more are on the way, and so we have many emulator-specific Categories with channels for specific purposes.

PRO TIP - VIEW ALL THE CHANNELS, PLEASE:   
  
`It is highly recommended as soon as you join to **_make sure you are viewing all the channels_** in our Discord server so you can know where to look and ask for help with your specific question or issue. Look in our Discord FAQ [HERE](//faqs/#discord-faq) for further help with that.`  
  
As an example - if you are looking for assistance with Osirus, you have a much greater chance of someone seeing and responding to your question if you post in the **#osirus-support** channel (and not in the off-topic **#general-chat** channel or some other totally unrelated channel).

**Search the Discord** for previous discussions about your question or issue. A simple search for basic keywords can usually point you in the right direction or link you to an applicable post that you can read through.  
  
**Make it a habit to frequently read Pinned Messages**, especially in the Support channels. Pinned Messages are required reading and can be viewed by clicking the "pin" icon at the top of a channel. Very important information such as download links, workarounds for known issues, and other critical information will be Pinned in the appropriate channel to keep this type of frequently asked-about information easy to find. When the same topic comes up many times we will typically address it once and Pin that answer so that everyone can find it there.

****Reporting Bugs** and Requesting Features**

If you encounter an actual bug that can be duplicated, we have a process dedicated for that purpose. We do have requirements for posting bug reports; we expect you to read and follow those requirements in order to receive assistance. This process is outlined in the **#tus-bug-reporting** channel in our Discord. We have a similar process for requesting features, the process for which can be found on the Discord in the **#tus-feature-requests** channel. Please understand that we expect that users do their homework before reporting bugs or requesting features to ensure that they are not operating the emulator/synth incorrectly or that their requested feature does not already exist. Many such reports or requests are rejected because of inadequate research or information.  
  
As a rule, we only officially support the most current version of our emulators, we only officially support the latest/final ROM/firmware versions, we do not officially support using BETA versions of DAWs, and we do not provide official support for issues found when using third-party skins.

**Guidelines for reporting a bug**:

_**A bug report should contain one and only one issue; do not cram many unrelated issues into one report or it may be deleted**_.

- Clear Simple Title

- Description of your environment to include relevant details such as OS (make and version), DAW (make and version), Plugin (version and type).

- Detailed Description of the issue (a video or audio clip may be helpful to demonstrate)

- Exact Steps to reproduce or duplicate the issue (again, a video may be helpful)

- Provide any applicable logs or crash dumps from your DAW if possible.

**_Without this type of detailed information about your environment, versions of Hardware/OS/DAW/plugin used, detailed steps to reproduce, rich media screenshots/audio/video clips, and especially crashdumps or logs, your issue may be difficult to verify and remediate. If you want your report to be useful to help us solve your issue, please remember to include all of this very important information._**

We of course want everyone in our community to have a great experience using our emulators, and thanks for helping us to help you by following these guidelines!
