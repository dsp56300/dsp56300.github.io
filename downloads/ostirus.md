Performance Test Download Links

If you are curious about how well your system will perform while running the emulator, please download and run the test program from one of the following links below to see if your CPU is capable of handling it. The Firmware for the Virus TI will need to be placed in the root of this folder for it to work (we can not provide Firmware files, so you will need to make your own arrangements)

[Win](https://dsp56300.com/builds/downloads.html?version=2.1.3&product=OsTIrusTestConsole&format=All&os=win64) / [Mac](https://dsp56300.com/builds/downloads.html?version=2.1.3&product=OsTIrusTestConsole&format=All&os=MacOS) / [Linux x64](https://dsp56300.com/builds/downloads.html?version=2.1.3&product=OsTIrusTestConsole&format=All&os=Linux_x86_64) / [Linux aarch64](https://dsp56300.com/builds/downloads.html?version=2.1.3&product=OsTIrusTestConsole&format=All&os=Linux_aarch64)

Once you have downloaded the test program, uncompressed it, and placed the firmware in the same folder, run the virusTestConsole.exe file by itself to execute the test running the Factory Demosong.

As the Virus TI runs each DSP at 133 MHz a combined result for both DSPs of 266 MIPs or more is needed to run it.  
  
The Virus TI Snow uses 1 DSP at 163 MHz, so 163 MIPs is needed to run it in Snow mode (currently not a configurable option for the Performance Test utility).
