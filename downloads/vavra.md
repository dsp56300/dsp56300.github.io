Please read these instructions carefully to save our Discord Server from being overloaded with questions regarding the setup of the emulator.

## Performance Test Download Links

If you are curious about how well your system will perform while running the emulator, please download and run the test program from one of the following links below to see if your CPU is capable of handling it. The ROM for the microQ will need to be placed in the root of this folder for it to work (we can not provide ROM files, so you will need to make your own arrangements)

[Win](https://dsp56300.com/builds/downloads.html?version=2.1.3&product=VavraPerformanceTest&format=All&os=win64) / [Mac](https://dsp56300.com/builds/downloads.html?version=2.1.3&product=VavraPerformanceTest&format=All&os=MacOS) / [Linux x64](https://dsp56300.com/builds/downloads.html?version=2.1.3&product=VavraPerformanceTest&format=All&os=Linux_x86_64) / [Linux aarch64](https://dsp56300.com/builds/downloads.html?version=2.1.3&product=VavraPerformanceTest&format=All&os=Linux_aarch64)

Once you have downloaded the test program, uncompressed it, and placed the firmware in the same folder, run the .bat files (Windows) or .sh files (Mac/Linux) and the Performance Test will execute and provide you with feedback on the performance of the emulator on your computer.

As the microQ runs at 118 MHz a result of 118 MIPs or more is needed to run it.
