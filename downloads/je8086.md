Performance Test Download Links

If you are curious about how well your system will perform while running the emulator, please download and run the test program from one of the following links below to see if your CPU is capable of handling it. The Firmware for the JP-8000 will need to be placed in the root of this folder for it to work (we can not provide Firmware files, so you will need to make your own arrangements)

[Win](https://dsp56300.com/builds/downloads.html?version=2.1.3&product=JE8086TestConsole&format=All&os=win64) / [Mac](https://dsp56300.com/builds/downloads.html?version=2.1.3&product=JE8086TestConsole&format=All&os=MacOS) / [Linux x64](https://dsp56300.com/builds/downloads.html?version=2.1.3&product=JE8086TestConsole&format=All&os=Linux_x86_64) / [Linux aarch64](https://dsp56300.com/builds/downloads.html?version=2.1.3&product=JE8086TestConsole&format=All&os=Linux_aarch64)

Once you have downloaded the test program, uncompressed it, and placed the firmware in the same folder, run the jeTestConsole.exe file by itself to execute the test running the Factory Demosong.

A result of 100% or better indicates that you can most likely run 1 instance of the emulator per core of your CPU. This scales roughly linearly; if you have >200% you should be able to run 2 instances per core, etc. Please make allowances for CPU used by other process running on your computer, your DAW, other plugins, etc. This is not a guarantee of performance, only an estimation.
