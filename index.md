Welcome to our site, dedicated to the emulation of classic digital synthesizers and effects processors.

We are The Usual Suspects, a dedicated group of people who are currently Reverse Engineering and Emulating various DSP processors that have been used in the design and implementation of digital musical instruments and effects processors over the years.

We began with the Motorola DSP563XX series of processors, which were used in many virtual analogue synthesizers and other musical gear that was released after around the mid 90s, such as Access Virus A, B, C, TI / Clavia Nord Lead 2X, 3, Modular / Waldorf Q, Microwave II / Novation Supernova, Nova and many others.  
  
We have since broadened our horizons and are branching out to research and realize emulations of many other DSP processing platforms, whether they are well-known or maybe even some that are bespoke and/or custom in nature.

Here is a video of the emulator in action, you can grab a copy of our various emulators from our downloads pages on the menu bar.
